						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Frequent Drupal Conference Traveler™</li>
							<li class="fragment">FOSS enthusiast</li>

							<li class="fragment">Former Local Government employee <br>(The City of Wrocław)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							- I like to Drupal-travel, visit places I've never visited before, using Drupal as an excuse<br>
							... or is it opposite?<br>
							- I value Free and Open Source Software<br>
							- I work as a Senior Drupal Developer for NyMedia, who, btw, sponsors this event (bravo)<br>
							- I used to work for local government in Wrocław, one of the biggest cities in Poland. My job
							was to deliver electronic platform which could easily scale with number of projects parent
							organisation was running at the same moment (campaigns, permanent projects). We ended up
							building multisite Drupal7 distribution with reusable base components and common installation profile.<br>
							Point is - there was many tasks, which had to be done over and over, and which could be
							eliminated by reusability pattern.<br>
							What we've could done better - share it with community.

					<section>
						<h2>Why this topic?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Given my experience it is something I care about :)<br>
							- How many of us have been in contact with public agency at least once during entire life?<br>
							- How many of us have been in contact with public agency (one or another) in last year?<br>
							- How many of you visited their website first?<br>
							- How many of you have found it modern and useful?<br>
							- Government's web-needs constantly grows.<br>
							- More and more public services provided by government needs their own, profiled website.<br>
							- Not just government but all state-founded agencies are part of public sector market.<br>
							- Data fragmentation is a problem.<br>
							- Website no longer just create and display content, but also consume content from 3rd party services
							and expose it to ones willing to consume the content.

						<h3 class="fragment">Public Information Bulletin</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							The Biuletyn Informacji Publicznej, BIP for short (or, the Bulletin of Public Information),
							is a Polish system of unified public records online, consisting of an array
							of standardized pages created with the general public in mind. For those
							interested in the operation of any particular institution in Poland or in finding a way
							of contacting them in order to settle a particular matter, the BIP given entry is often
							the optimal source of data and background information.
							Or it is suppose to be one :)
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Public Information Bulletin</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Every Polish citizen has right to access Public Information</li>
							<li class="fragment">Every public entity, such as local government or public agency, must provide
								standardized access to public data</li>
							<li class="fragment">Content can be modified only by creating new revision. Citizen
								must have access to content revision history. Content cannot be deleted.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Public data must be well structured.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Content must be stored along with information who and when
								created and modified it</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="img/5.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							Why I'm telling this? Because every public entity which operates based on public funds must have
							one of these. All of theme are structured exactly the same. All of them can even look
							the same (usually separate domain from website). All BIP instances struggles with the same maintenance tasks.
							Can you see where I'm going here? Room for FOSS!

						<h2>Why FOSS matters?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Cost effective</li>
							<li class="fragment">Security</li>
							<li class="fragment">Stability</li>
							<li class="fragment">Avoiding vendor lock in</li>
							<li class="fragment">Reusability</li>
							<li class="fragment">Transparency and freedom</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Drupal is entirely free and doesn't have licensing fees<br>
							- Supporting communities identify and address vulnerabilities fast and provide with security patches<br>
							- Drupal allows Government to not lock-in on any proprietary formats or systems<br>
							- Features aren't tied to a vendor's product roadmap or agenda<br>
							- Open source Drupal inherently promotes and facilitates reusability. Reusable Drupal modules
							not only accelerates broader adoptions across various government agencies, but also
							significantly drive down the overall IT cost<br>
							- In addition, it aligns with the core civic values of transparency and freedom.
							Many government organizations have contributed open source modules to the community,
							sharing their innovations with others.

						<aside class="notes">
							This sound a bit too technical, doesn't it? Let's take example description from one of the most popular gov distributions.

						<blockquote>
							The X distribution combines Drupal Core and Drupal modules to enable the quick creation of government websites. Managed and maintained by the Department of Y, the distribution is WCAG 2.0 AA compliant and follows best-practice service design.

						<aside class="notes">
							What does it mean in practice? That we can easily build sites which are:
